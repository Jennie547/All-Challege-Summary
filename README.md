<h3 style="color: #15e0ff"> INTRODUCTION </h3>

<p>
<b>
Bash, <i style="background-color: #00000033">Bourne-Again Shell</i>, is the most used Linux/Unix shells making it mostly the default in many Linux distributions.

<h3 style="color: #15e0ff">BASH SCRIPTING</h3>
<p>
<b>
All Bash scripts end with the <strong>.sh</strong> extension although they would run just fine without it.
What matters most in Bash is the <strong>Shebang</strong>. This is combining <strong>bash(#)</strong> and <strong>bang(!)</strong> followed by the path. It is known as the interpreter. It is written thus, <strong>#!/bin/bash</strong>.

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

C programming is a powerful and widely-used programming language that is commonly used for system programming, embedded systems, and application development. It is known for its efficiency and flexibility, making it a popular choice for developers.

Creating a C file involves writing code in the C programming language, which is a powerful and versatile language commonly used for system programming and software development. Here are some important things to keep in mind when creating a C file:

1. File extension: C files typically have a ".c" extension, which indicates that the file contains C code.

2. Compiler: In order to compile and run a C file, you will need a C compiler installed on your system. Popular C compilers include GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) and Clang.

3. Include statements: If your C file uses functions or libraries from external header files, you will need to include them using the "#include" directive at the beginning of your file.

4. Main function: Every C program must have a main function, which serves as the entry point for the program. The main function is where the program starts executing.

5. Syntax: C is a case-sensitive language, so make sure to pay attention to the case of your variable names and function calls. Also, don't forget to end each statement with a semicolon (;).

6. Comments: Use comments to document your code and explain its purpose. Comments in C are denoted by "//" for single-line comments and "/* */" for multi-line comments.

7. Variables: Declare variables at the beginning of your functions and initialize them before use. C is a statically-typed language, so you need to specify the data type of each variable.

8. Functions: Break your code into smaller, reusable functions to make it more modular and easier to maintain. Functions in C are declared with a return type, name, and parameters.

9. Memory management: In C, memory management is manual, so make sure to allocate and deallocate memory properly using functions like malloc() and free().

10. Error handling: Always check for errors and handle them appropriately to prevent crashes or unexpected behavior in your program.

By following these guidelines and practicing regularly, you will become more proficient in creating C files and writing efficient, reliable code. Good luck!
